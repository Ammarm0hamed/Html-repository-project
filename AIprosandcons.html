    <td>Artificial intelligence can be used in mining or other process of exploration. The machines used in this area, as well as the robots, are so complex that they can be used for exploring the ocean floor. The intelligent robots also can be sent to explore space, because they are made with metal bodies and are more resistant to maintain in the space.</td>
    <td>Artificial intelligence is replacing many skilled jobs, and that is how some people will lose their job. For example, many robots have taken jobs in the assembly line. Also, there are these new, driverless cars that could replace millions of human drivers, such as taxi or bus drivers.</td>

    <td>The smartphones are a simple example of how we use AI in our everyday life. We are travelling with GPS, using the virtual assistants such as Siri, taking pictures and detecting the person’s face, etc.</td>
    <td>The AI is much expensive. Only the well-funded schools can allow themselves to use and to earn from AI. Robots can also cost a lot of money and resources if they are repaired or rebuilt.</td>

  <tr>
  <td>Machines are able to think faster than humans and they can be easily put into multitasking. For that reason, the machines are used in performing some more dangerous tasks.</td>
  <td>People are becoming more and more addicted and dependent to smartphones and their capacities, so they are often forgetting about their mental abilities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>The games we play are actually made of artificial intelligence. The machine inside the computer plans the game and its movements, as a return to our movement.</td>
  <td>The AI technology can help you to do creative designs, but they are not able to advise you how to do something creative, because they do not have the human brain.

  <td>Doctors use AI to easily detect some diseases or health risks. Moreover, even in surgeries doctors have the help of the artificial intelligence. Robots are often used for curing the mental diseases, they help people to fight depression.</td>

  <td>AI machines can predict what a user will search, ask, type, they can also recommend some actions according to the user’s needs. They are replacing people in many tasks. Also, they think without emotions, and that is why they make reasonable decisions without mistakes.</td>
  <td>If the AI gets in the hand of the wrong person, it can be used as a dangerous weapon and lead to big problems. People can easily lose control over the technologies and cause danger.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
  <td>Artificial intelligence enables virtual teaching, meetings, learning, connecting people from everywhere in the world. </td>
  <td>The artificial intelligence cannot be improved with experience, like humans can. Their way of storing data is very different from the human intelligence.</td>

  <tr>
  <td>AI has developed machine translation. Of course, it cannot be as accurate and precise as the human translation, but in some situations it can be a faster and a more efficient solution </td>

  <td>When programmed properly, the machines will not make mistakes as the humans do. They are processing the data without errors, no matter of its size. </td>
